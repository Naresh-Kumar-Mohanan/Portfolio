# Portfolio Deployment Steps - GitHub Pages 🚀

Follow these steps to host your portfolio on GitHub:

### 1️⃣ Push Latest Changes to GitHub
Since your project is already on GitHub, ensure your latest local changes are pushed to your `main` branch:
1. Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Final polish - Ready for live"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 2️⃣ Configuration Verification
I have already pre-configured these for you, but it's good to know:
*   **package.json**: Contains `"homepage": "https://Naresh-Kumar-Mohanan.github.io/My-Portfolio"` and deployment scripts.
*   **vite.config.js**: Contains `base: "/My-Portfolio/"` to ensure assets (images/CSS) load correctly.

### 3️⃣ Deployment Command
Simply run this single command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
*   **What this does**: It automatically builds your project (`npm run build`) and pushes the `dist` folder to a special branch called `gh-pages` on your GitHub.

### 4️⃣ Activate GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Naresh-Kumar-Mohanan/My-Portfolio`
2. Click on **Settings** (top tab).
3. Click on **Pages** (left sidebar).
4. Under **Build and deployment > Branch**:
   - Ensure **Branch** is set to `gh-pages`.
   - Ensure the folder is set to `/(root)`.
   - Click **Save** if you made changes.

### 5️⃣ View Your Site
After a minute or two, your site will be live at:
🔗 **https://Naresh-Kumar-Mohanan.github.io/My-Portfolio/**

---

### 💡 How to update your site in the future?
Whenever you make changes to your code:
1. Run `git add .`, `git commit -m "Update message"`, and `git push` to save your code.
2. Run `npm run deploy` to update the live website. Done! ✨
