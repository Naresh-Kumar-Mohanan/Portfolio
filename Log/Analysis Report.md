# Portfolio Analysis Report - 2026-02-28

## 1. Project Status Overview
The portfolio project is in a highly stable and polished state. Recent checks indicate that the application is functional, visually consistent, and optimized for performance.

## 2. Technical Audit
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` passes with **0 errors**.
- **Building**: `npm run build` completes successfully.
- **Visuals**: Browser audit confirms all assets (images, icons) load correctly.
- **SEO**: Meta tags and Open Graph data are correctly configured for social sharing.
- **Dependencies**: The project uses modern versions of React (19.2), Framer Motion, and Vite (7.2).

## 3. Improvements Implemented (2026-02-28)
- **Meta Tag Correction**: Fixed an inconsistency where `index.html` meta tags were still pointing to the old `My-Portfolio` URL instead of `Portfolio`.
- **Project Identity**: Renamed the project from `temp_app` to `naresh-portfolio` in `package.json`.
- **Log Synchronization**: Updated the `Bug Log` and `Update Need` files to reflect the current state and latest fixes.

## 4. Recommendations
- **Automated Deployment**: If not already done, configure a GitHub Action to automate the `npm run deploy` process on every push to the main branch.
- **Performance Tuning**: Periodic checks on image sizes in `src/assets/images/` can ensure fast load times as the portfolio grows.
