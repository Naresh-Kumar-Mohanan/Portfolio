# Portfolio Analysis Report - 2026-02-28

## 1. Project Status Overview
The portfolio project is now fully functional and resolves the "blank page" issue previously reported. The application is visually stunning, performance-optimized, and correctly configured for GitHub Pages deployment.

## 2. Technical Audit
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` passes (minor warnings possible, 0 errors).
- **Building**: `npm run build` completes successfully with all assets correctly base-pathed to `/Portfolio/`.
- **Runtime**: Tested and verified that the React component tree mounts correctly and the preloader hides as expected.
- **Dependencies**: Verified all `framer-motion` usages are correctly imported.

## 3. Improvements Implemented (2026-02-28)
- **Resolved Blank Page**: Fixed a critical `ReferenceError` in `Projects.jsx` and improved preloader removal reliability.
- **Marquee Scroll Restored**: Re-implemented the automated marquee scroll for the Projects section to provide a dynamic, cinematic experience.
- **Insight Expansion Interaction**: Maintained the sophisticated depth-shift reveal interaction within the scrolling marquee.
- **Improved Mounting**: Added fallback mechanisms to ensure the site is never stuck on a loader.
- **Meta Tag Correction**: (Previously done) Fixed repository URL inconsistencies.

## 4. Recommendations
- **Deployment**: Run `npm run deploy` to push the latest fixes to GitHub Pages.
- **Browser Testing**: Since the project name changed from `My-Portfolio` to `Portfolio`, ensure all links in external profiles (LinkedIn, etc.) are updated to `https://Naresh-Kumar-Mohanan.github.io/Portfolio/`.
