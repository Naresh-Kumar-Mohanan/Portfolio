# Portfolio Test Report - 2026-02-28

## 1. Issue Diagnosed: Blank Page on Deployment
The user reported a "blank page" issue after deploying to GitHub Pages. Local testing with `npm run preview` also reproduced the issue (a black screen stuck on the preloader).

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
Two critical issues were identified:
1.  **Missing Component Import**: `src/components/Projects.jsx` was using the `<motion />` component from `framer-motion` but did not import it. This caused a `ReferenceError` that prevented the React application from mounting correctly.
2.  **Unreliable Preloader Removal**: The preloader removal logic in `main.jsx` was using `window.addEventListener('load', ...)`. In a modern Vite/React SPA, the `load` event can fire before or during the mounting phase, or even before the script executes, making it an unreliable trigger for hiding the preloader.

## 3. Fixes Implemented
1.  **Added Missing Import**: Fixed `Projects.jsx` by adding `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`.
2.  **Robust Preloader Logic**: 
    - Moved the preloader removal logic to `App.jsx` using a `useEffect` hook, which ensures it only runs after the application has successfully mounted.
    - Added a 5-second fallback timeout in `main.jsx` to ensure the preloader is removed even if a catastrophic error prevents React from mounting.
3.  **Code Sanitization**: Cleaned up mounting logic to prevent errors if the `#root` element is missing.

## 4. Test Results
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` completed without errors.
- **Local Preview**: `npm run preview` now successfully displays the portfolio.
- **Asset Loading**: Verified that all assets (JS, CSS, Images) load correctly under the `/Portfolio/` base path.
- **Visual Audit**: Confirmed via browser subagent that the Hero, Projects, Skills, and Reviews sections are rendered and visible.

## 5. Deployment Instructions
The fixes are now in the source code. To update the live site, please run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
